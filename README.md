# docker-hello-world
Just, like, you know, a docker container, that, like, when you talk to it, says, like, Hello.

#### Why?

To play with docker.  To make a minimal-as-possible, and small-as-possible container.  To experiment with continuous integration, and eventually continuous deployment.

Note: This project is being built by flynn which uses heroku buildpacks to build slugs into docker containers. So there is no docker file right now.
